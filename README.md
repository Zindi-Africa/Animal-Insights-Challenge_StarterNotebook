[**Animal Insights Challenge**](https://zindi.africa/competitions/animal-insights-challenge)

Go to Zindi to download the data. 

In the early 1990s, a group of volunteers organised an event in the [Mana Pools National Park](https://www.managamecount.co.zw/contacts.html), Zimbabwe. The goal: to count the animals present on the central floodplain. The first attempt was a success, and the game count became an annual event. Each year, on a weekend close to the full moon in September, citizen scientists head to the park armed with clipboards and camping gear. Working in teams, they walk set transects through the bush, counting all the animals they encounter. The data helps us understand the health of the park, and can give us some insights into the lives of the animals surveyed. And that’s where you come in.

This is not a prediction challenge (although predictive solutions are allowed). Instead, we’re giving you the data and asking you to dig in, tease out the hidden patterns, and share your findings with us. There may be all sorts of interesting trends hidden in the data, and the hope is that by exploring this together we will be able to unlock insights that might escape the notice of a single ecologist or researcher.

The *objective of this challenge* is to interpret and generate insights from the data from 1995 to 2019 in the Mana Pools National Park.

You are invited to come up with an original visualization and/or a written report using the data provided.

The prize for this challenge is a paid for 6 week course and internship with [iXperience](https://ixperience.co/remote) valued at $3,195 USD.
